    <p>Hi everyone!<br>
        My name is Nate and I am from Jamaica Plain, MA. I work at a place called Einstein's Workshop, a STEM education center for middle school aged students, where I teach a class on 3D printing. I am currently on a gap year as I transfer from one university to another, and in the meantime, I am taking courses to fulfill requirements and also courses that I think will be useful in the future. I am planning on entering a career in game design with a focus on programming, and I am currently developing a curriculum for a new course at my job on making games using Unity.</p>
